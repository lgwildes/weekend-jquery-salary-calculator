# WEEKEND JQUERY SALARY CALCULATOR

## Description

_Duration for Basic: 4 hours +2 hours additional CSS work_

In this project I needed to create a form which would take employee data and calculate monthly costs for all salaried employees. 

I created a basic HTML form with inputs for all employee data. I added a submit button which appends the inputed employee data to the DOM and calculates their monthly salary which it adds to the total monthly cost (this is also displayed on the DOM). If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, the monthly cost will become highlighted in red to alert the user. Next to each employee listed on the DOM is a delete button which will remove that single employee from the DOM.
